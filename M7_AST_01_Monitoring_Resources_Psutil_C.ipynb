What that means is that if there are 8 cores in the CPU, 8 different processes can be spawned to attempt 8 different tasks simultaneously. An additional module called `ProcessPoolExecutor` is used here. It is a subclass that executes calls asynchronously using a pool object. One benefit of using a process pool executor is that it returns a generator object instead of a simple list containing the results. It is possible to iterate over results we can simple call __next__ on it."
